🗝 Predictable, Natural Solution for unique React list keys 🔑

For certain cases where there is no natural key for an item in a list it can be frustrating to create an artificial key for it.
For example, if something hasn't been saved to the server yet and so has no ID, a unique artificial key for each item would have to be created to appease React's list rendering.
`react-list-keys` solves this problem by doing key generation for you.

```bash
npm install react-list-keys
```

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactKeyGen from 'react-list-keys';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  state = {
    items: [],
    keyGen: new ReactKeyGen(),
  }

  componentWillMount() {
    this.addItem({ title: 'apple' });
    this.addItem({ title: 'banana' });
  }

  addItem = (item) => {
    this.setState(state => ({
      items: [
        ...state.items,
        state.keyGen.keyed(item),
      ]
    }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <ul>
        {this.state.items.map(item => (
          <li key={item._key}>{item.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    );
  }
}
```

## How it works

`react-list-keys` adds an unenumerable prop `_key` to your objects.
This means that submitting this object via fetch, destructuring the object,
etc will not show the `_key` prop, yet it is there.

*Example:*

```javascript
const keyGen = new ReactKeyGen();
const a = keyGen.keyed({ apples: 1, oranges: 'are great', bananas: null });
a._key // 1

const b = { ...a }; // or Object.assign({}, a);
b._key // undefined
```

While this might seem like a weakness, it's actually very important so that it
does not change the structure of your data upon submission or other things.

If you would like to do this object shallow copying, you can do it simply with
the provided utility function. In the example above, this would be:

```javascript
const c = keyGen.copy(a);
c._key // 1
c === a // false
```

**Note**: If your object already has some sort of unique value that could be used as a key
for react, it is prefered to use that one. This library's intention is to supplement
items without natural keys.
